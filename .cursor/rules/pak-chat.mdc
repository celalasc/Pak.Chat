## Main Components

### Input Field

*   Send button — sends the message
*   Stop button — stops response generation
*   Model selection button — opens a modal window with LLM model options
*   Adaptive positioning:
    *   If there are no messages, the input field is centered on the screen
    *   In the centered state, the model selection modal window opens from the bottom (not the top)
*   Quoting:
    *   When quoting AI text, the input field expands
    *   The quoted text is displayed with a special background.
    *   A cross icon in the top right corner to cancel quoting. Below the cross, a tooltip "Press Esc"
    *   Quotes longer than 2 lines become scrollable
*   When the user scrolls up, an arrow should appear to the right above the input field. Clicking it scrolls down.
*   Before the button that opens the model selection window, there should be a "+" icon. Clicking it should open a small window containing buttons: [File icon] Add file, [Arrow icon] Recent, [Brush icon] Draw.

### Chat Navigation

*   Each bar represents a user message
*   The length of the bar corresponds to the length of the message
